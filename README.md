Hi 👋, I’m Akram!

Data Analyst and Business Analyst | Master’s in Business Analytics @ Cal State East Bay

I turn large data into actionable strategies using:
🐍 Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) for analysis and predictive modeling
📊 SQL (CTEs, window functions, stored procedures) to wrangle complex datasets
🎨 Tableau/Power BI for storytelling through visuals
🧩 Excel (VLOOKUP, macros, pivot tables) for quick-turn insights

Check out my work below ↓ I build tools that solve real-world problems.
